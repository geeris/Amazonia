                                The Amazon is one of the most exotic & biologically diverse regions on Earth, and is home to the most spectacular Amazon Rainforest animals you can imagine. Legendary for the sheer vastness of its size, its 1.4 billion acres of tropical forest cover some 40% of the South American continent, making up just over half of the entire planet’s remaining tropical forest lands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Given its enormity, then, it’s no surprise that the Amazon basin itself is home to some of the most diverse flora & fauna on the planet. In fact, there’s no other biome in the world as rich in plant & animal life as the Amazon basin. Roughly 1 out of every 10 known animal species can be found in the Amazon Rainforest. For birds, that figure rises to 1 out of every 5.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Specifically, the Amazon Rainforest is home to 427 mammals, 78 reptiles, over 400 amphibians, and some 1,300 birds. The most fascinating part? These are only the species we know. Biologists estimate that we are still yet to discover the vast majority of Amazon animals that call this utopic wildlife repository home. Recent research even shows that, on average, a new Amazonian species is discovered every 2 days.
                        </p>

                                Fortunately for nature lovers, the Amazonian territories of countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia & Peru have been kept largely unspoiled. Owing to the idyllic, undisturbed nature of these nation’s Amazonian habitats, travellers can expect to see some of the rarest & most spectacular Amazon Rainforest animals imaginable. So, without further ado, here are the 7 Amazon animals our experts recommend you look out for during your Amazon jungle trek:

                        According to the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, there are only three characteristics unique to mammals. The three characteristics are mammary glands (an adaptation that requires an investment of time and energy to care for the newborn offspring), hair and three middle ear bones (commonly called the hammer, anvil and stirrup).

                            Amazon Rainforest mammals include many of the favourites to search for on Amazon Jungle Tours. From Amazon Monkeys to rodents, the forest is teeming with our mammalian relatives.
                            Amazon mammals have successfully colonised the ground, the trees, and the air filling the jungle with a diversity of different species. You are sure to see many on your Amazon tour. Try and look out for the dark looking balls on the tops of the tallest trees as these could be sloths, one of the Amazon’s most commonly seen large mammals.

                                        Giant armadillos are solitary and nocturnal, spending the day in burrows.[4] They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball.
                                 </p>
                                 <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Habits and life </h5>
                                 <p >
                                        Giant armadillos are mainly nocturnal animals. The armadillo usually forages alone and socializes only for mating. When another Giant armadillo appears on its home range, this animal does not defend the territory, preferring to simply ignore the intruder. Giant armadillos are terrestrial mammals. 
                                       
                                 </p> <p class="mb-5">
                                            They dig large burrows for resting, using their third claws, which act like spades. They can keep balance, standing on their hind legs and tail. Due to this ability,they are able to reach out termite mounds (they frequently use this technique when warding off predators). After destroying the mound, the armadillo will arrange itself under the remains of the mound, staying there for up to 24 hours and then moving on.
                                 </p>
                                 <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Diet </h5>
                                 <p class="mb-5"> 
                                        Giant armadillos are carnivores (insectivores).Their usual diet primarily consists of termites, though they can also consume ants, spiders, larvae and worms.
                                 </p>

                                 <p class="mb-2">
                                        Giant armadillo attracts hunters for its meat and primarily – for subsistence. The animal is threatened by loss of habitat due to deforestation. Being considered as a pest, this animal is frequently killed by farmers throughout the area of its habitat. And finally, the species is threatened by illegal trade, being captured and sold to wealthy animal collectors.

                                            Amazon river dolphins are active during the daytime, and are most likely to be seen any time from early in the morning until late afternoon. When they sleep, they do so with one eye open. Their diet is mostly comprised of fish, but they may also eat turtles, crabs and shellfish. To attract a mate, the males will carry branches or other items in their mouths to suggest to the females that they would like to mate. They breed seasonally and have their pups in May and June time. This is when there is flooding in their habitat, and this gives the female and its babies the best chance of survival.
                                 </p>
                                 <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Behaviour </h5>
                                 <p >
                                        While other species of dolphin may spend their time in larger groups, the pink river dolphin prefers to spend its time either alone or in groups of just two to four creatures. Occasionally they may be spotted in larger groups if there is a lot of food in a particular area. They tend to live in whitewater, clearwater and blackwater rivers that are fast flowing, but they can also be found in lakes, major tributaries and sometimes in flooded Rainforests in the rainy season.
                                 </p>
                                <p class="mb-5">
                                        Similarly to marine dolphins, the Amazon pink dolphin will interact with people. This is because they have a naturally inquisitive nature, and they are rather outgoing. They do not often leap above the water, as marine dolphins may be seen to do. Interestingly, they do seem to like swimming upside down. The reason for this is believed to be so that they can keep an eye on what is going on below them in the murky depths of the Amazon River.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Habitat </h5>
                                 <p>
                                        The Amazon pink dolphin, is scattered  throughout  the main ramifications;  canals  and water  falls, of the Amazon River,  Orinoco River and the Madeira River in Bolivia. During the dry season, they are usually located in the wide river beds ,  since in the smaller water spaces, it is very difficult for them to hunt. They can also be found in small lake formations that connect with rivers, waterfalls or prominent waterfalls at the mouths of rivers.
                                 </p>

                                        It must be taken into account that there is a difference in the habitat preference between males and females; in the case of males they prefer to return to the main channels of the rivers, even when they are still high; while the females and their offspring remain in the most flooded areas for a long time.

                                        The diet of the Amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales. It consists of at least 53 different species of fish, grouped in 19 families. The prey size is between 5 and 80 centimetres, with an average of 20 centimetres. The most frequently consumed fish like Croakers, Tetras and Piranhas. The dolphin’s dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs.The diet is more diverse during the wet season, when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds, thus becoming more difficult to catch. The diet becomes more selective during the dry season when prey density is greater

                                        These creatures are in danger of extinction, due to the accelerated destruction of their habitat. It is believed that at least 50% of the population this species has decreased in the last 10 years, due to the occupation of the areas where they live, which strongly affects their life quality.The high levels of pollution in the Amazon River, have increased the number of deaths of this species, especially those that inhabit near gold mines where large amounts of mercury are employed to extract it.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                        Different Studies carried out in several rivers and populations such as those of the Madera River in Brazil, show that the mercury levels  in such rivers is above the permissible limit, which constitutes a great threat to this species that is at the top of the chain food.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                        The exploitation of oil is also a threat to this species, the oil spills has resulted in many losses in their habitat not only of the pink dolphins of the Amazon but other species.

                                 <p>
                                        The hunt of this species has also increased, since its meat is employed as bait to catch certain fish, such as speck or piracatinga, among other species.

                                        Although in particular there is no constant predator of the Amazon pink dolphin, it has been known that the black alligator, the bull shark, the anaconda and the jaguar could eventually be the natural predators of this creature.
                                        By the characteristics of the bites that have been in found in some specimens, the experts speculate that they can be attributed to catfish although no theory has yet been proven.

                                    Young tapirs reach sexual maturity between three and five years of age, with females maturing earlier than males. Under good conditions, a healthy female tapir can reproduce every two years; a single young, called a calf, is born after a gestation of about 13 months. The natural lifespan of a tapir is about 25 to 30 years, both in the wild and in zoos. Apart from mothers and their young offspring, tapirs lead almost exclusively solitary lives.

                                Although they frequently live in dryland forests, tapirs with access to rivers spend a good deal of time in and underwater, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves under water to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies.Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.

                                Tapirs preferred habitats are woodlands and dense grassy areas with a close water source such as lake or river. Old growth forests are also favoured because of the food sources found within them.

                                Tapirs are herbivores that feed up on water plants, fruits and buds. These mammals will also eat twigs and leaves. They use their long snouts to forage along the ground in search of food. Tapirs have been known to consume up to 40 kilograms (85 pounds) of vegetation in one day.

                                Tapirs have very few natural predators because they are large animals and the thick skin on their necks makes it more difficult for a predator to grasp the animal. Most threats come from large cats such as Jaguars and Tigers, also snakes such as the Anaconda and Crocodiles when in water. Tapirs can also run rather quickly despite their size and are able to quickly find safety in the thick undergrowths of the forests or in water. When faced with a predator, a Tapir is able to defend itself using its strong jaws and sharp teeth.

                    <p>
                            Reptiles, like amphibians, make up a fairly small proportion of terrestrial animals—but in the form of dinosaurs, they ruled the earth for over 150 million years. There are four basic types of reptiles: crocodiles and alligators, turtles and tortoises, snakes, and lizards. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Reptiles are characterized by their cold-blooded metabolisms—they fuel themselves up by exposure to the sun—their scaly skin, and their leathery eggs, which, unlike amphibians, they can lay some distance away from bodies of water. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            There are more than 450 species of lizards, snakes, turtles, tortoises, and caiman in the Amazon Basin. Reptiles are an important food source for people in the Amazon. 
                        Many reptiles species are illegally collected an exported for the international pet trade. Live animals are the fourth largest commodity in the smuggling industry after drugs, diamonds, and weapons. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Most reptiles, such as the boa, are carnivorous (they feed exclusively on other animals) while others, such as the green iguana, are primarily herbivorous (they eat mostly plant matter).

                                        Basilisk can be distinguished from similar species within its range by its large size and the high fin-like crest along its back. Most common basilisks are brown and cream in colour. Males also have high crests on the head and tail. Both sexes are brown to olive, and have a white, cream, or yellow stripe on the upper lip and a second stripe along either side of the body; these stripes have higher contrast in juveniles and fade as the lizards age.

                                        The lizards can run on water because they have a fringe of scales on their hind toes which makes little webs that can trap bubbles of air and water beneath their feet. This keeps them from sinking into the water if they run quickly enough across. When they do stop running they don’t mind taking a little swim. The smaller lizards can run further than the bigger and heavier ones. Basilisks usually weigh between 200-600 grams (0.44 - 1.3 lbs) and may grow to be about 2 feet (61 cm) long although they average about 1 foot (30.5 cm) in length.

                                        Common basilisks have sharp eyesight. They remain active during the day while overhanging the water from vegetation. Most of the time is spend near water. He is as fast runners over the water surface as they are on the ground. For them there is no difference between the two surfaces. They run on two legs just like we do.
                                        While running on two legs, the common basilisk maintains balance with its tail. Heavier adults however fail to run as fast as young do. Thanks to these legs with the help of which they are able to escape aquatic predators.
                                        
                                    They spend night on branches that may or may not be hanging over the water. But if they fall into the water basilisks run more than 50 feet to swim to the side of the stream.The speed of the common basilisk is around 11 km/h on ground however on water the average speed is 8.4 km/h.

                                    The common basilisk’s diet also includes aquatic crustaceans, fish, non-insect arthropods, fish, reptiles, and small birds.
                                    Basilisks are typically opportunistic hunters in that they consume anything anywhere ranging from beetles or ants to the hummingbirds.

                                        The common basilisk has many natural predators: large reptiles, birds, and some mammals. To avoid predators, it can conceal itself under leaves on the forest floor and can remain motionless for a long time. When the common basilisk must flee, though, its skill of running on water can help it avoid many predators, and when the common basilisk can no longer run on the water, it will use its strong swimming capabilities to continue underwater.

                                        They like to live in the tropical and riparian forests that are abundant in rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. Basilisks occupy riverbank habitats as well as Guanacaste dry forest and the wetlands of the southwestern Costa Rica.

Pit vipers see the world in a combination of heat and light. The receptors detect warm blooded prey but also can detect cold blooded prey, though they're more responsive to warm.

                                            Vipers are a large family of snakes; the scientific name is Viperidae. They are found all over the world, with the exceptions of Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar, north of the Arctic Circle and island clusters such as Hawaii. 
                                            The family Viperidae includes adders, pit vipers (like rattlesnakes, cottonmouths and copperheads), the Gaboon viper, green vipers and horned vipers.

                                        Vipers' habitats vary across their nearly worldwide range. They live in mountains, Rainforests, fields and deserts. 
                                 </p>

                                 <p>
                                        Vipers in general tend to have enzymetic venom that affects general tissues.It causes intense swelling, pain and necrosis, which is cell death and decay. It also functions as an anticoagulant. Death usually occurs from a dramatic collapse in blood pressure. All viper bites should be treated seriously and medical attention should be paid. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="mb-5">
                                        In addition to killing prey and injuring predators, viper venom helps vipers digest their food, according to Sfetcu. Since they swallow their prey whole, digesting it is a big job not helped by vipers' generally inefficient digestive systems. The venom breaks down lipids, acids and proteins in the prey during the digestive process. 
                                 </p>

                                 <p> 
                                       Vipers eat a variety of food depending on the size of the snake. Prey includes small mammals, birds, lizards and eggs, according to Savitzky. When their prey is dead, they swallow it whole.
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="mb-2">
                                        Their perceived sluggishness impacts their hunting tactics. "Most vipers are ambush predators. They detect where prey is most likely to be chemically and just wait. Because they're not expending a lot of energy, low resting metabolic rate, and eat large things, they can afford to do that."
                                 </p>

                                    The Black Caimans general appearance is similar to the American Alligator. As their common name suggests, Black Caimans have a dark colouration.A Black Caimans lower jaw has grey banding (brown in older animals) and pale yellow or white bands are present across their flanks of the body, although these are more prominent in juveniles.A Black Caimans skin colouration helps with camouflage during its nocturnal hunts, but may also help absorb heat.

                                The Black Caiman is found in various freshwater habitats such as slow-moving rivers, streams, lakes, flooded savannahs and wetlands.
                                Although overlapping with the range of other caiman species in South America, it appears to occupy different habitat niches.

                                Black caimans are carnivores. Fish are the major part of this animal’s diet, especially catfish and the dangerous piranha, but adults also go after much larger prey like capybara, turtles, deer, cats and dogs. Juveniles eat smaller foods, including crustaceans, snails and other invertebrates, and fish.

                                For many years, this species was hunted heavily for its tough skin, to make shiny, black leather. Over the last century, this extreme hunting pressure reduced the overall population by 99 per cent, and it is now almost extinct in some places, such as Colombia, as well as the Amazon River itself. Populations continue to be impacted by illegal hunting, as well as habitat destruction through deforestation swamplands being burnt. Competition with the more common spectacled caiman may also threaten Black caiman populations.

                <p>
                        Birds evolved from dinosaurs—not once, but probably multiple times—during the Mesozoic Era, and today they are by far the most prolific flying vertebrates, numbering about 10,000 species spread across 30 separate orders. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        Birds are characterized by their coats of feathers, their warm-blooded metabolisms, their memorable songs (at least in certain species), and their ability to adapt to a wide range of habitats—witness the ostriches of the Australian plains and the penguins of the Antarctic coastline.
                </p>
                <p>
                        At one site in the Peruvian Amazon, about 575 bird species have been identified within a mere 5,500-hectare section of the Rainforest. By comparison, 700 bird species are found in the whole of North America.
                </p>
                <p>
                        From November to March, some birds migrate from North America to the Central American and South American tropics. Others are found exclusively in the Amazon Rainforest.

                                    Harpy eagles spend considerable amounts of time perched and listening. Having identified a prey, they glide toward it with claws extended and grab the victim as they swoop. Because of their larger size, females attack larger prey than males.

                                    With the exception of some areas of Panama, the species is almost extinct in Central America, subsequent to the logging of much of the Rainforest there. The harpy eagle inhabits tropical lowland Rainforests and may occur within such areas from the canopy to the emergent vegetatio. They have been found in areas where high-grade forestry is practiced.

                                    The most common prey taken by Harpy Eagles are arboreal or primarily arboreal mammals and birds. Monkeys are an important part of the diet in many populations of Harpy Eagles, although in some cases no single species of monkeys is of primary importance.Sloths also are a particularly important part of the diet in many populations of Harpy Eagle.

                                    Nonetheless, like all forest species, it is threatened by large scale deforestation.
                                    Unfortunately, the greatest threat to Harpy Eagles is direct persecution. Although Harpy Eagles can breed close to human settlements, if left undisturbed, they often are shot, either to satisfy curiosity or because of the perceived threat of a large raptor to livestock

                                    The scarlet ibis is a sociable and gregarious bird, and very communally-minded regarding the search for food and the protection of the young. They live in flocks of thirty or more. Members stay close, and mating pairs arrange their nests in close proximity to other pairs in the same tree.
                                    For protection, flocks often congregate in large colonies of several thousand individuals. They also regularly share time among other avian creatures, gaining additional safety through numbers: storks, spoonbills, egrets, herons and ducks are all common companions during feedings and flights.

                                    Their distinctive long, thin bills are used to probe for food in soft mud or under plants. Popularly imagined to be eating only shrimp, a recent study in Llanos has found that much of their diet consists of insects, of which the majority were scarabs and ground beetles .

                       The toucan, family of Ramphastos species, is a ubiquitous symbol of the Amazon, instantly recognized by its colourful bill, which is almost the same length as its body. The plumage is equally colourful, and includes patches of green, yellow, red and white. It ranges in size from 31 cm to 61 cm.

                            These large toucans alternate between flapping with heavy wingbeats and gliding and their flight is slightly undulating in character. During the day, many species of toucan become inactive and rest periodically in the treetops. Toucans make good use of their bill for many tasks including feeding, defense, courtship, and preening and are capable of hanging mostly upside down and using their bill to reach into difficult areas to obtain fruit

                     <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Habitat </h5>
                     <p class="mb-5">
                            The species occurs in lowland moist forests and montane cloud forests, where it nests and roosts in tree cavities. Although toucans are heard all the time in Rainforests, they are rarely seen because they mostly stay high up in the canopy.
                     </p>
                     <h5 class="senka mb-2 specijalni"> Diet </h5>
                     <p class="mb-5"> 
                            They are primarily frugivores (fruit eaters), and prefer the ripest fruits. Toucans pick fruit with their bill and hold it at its tip. Then they tilt their head backwards and gulp the food. In addition to fruits and berries, toucans eat spiders, insects, lizards and snakes, as well as nesting birds and eggs.
                            They typically feed in the canopy individually or in small groups but also forage in the understory or on the ground, especially for fallen fruits.
