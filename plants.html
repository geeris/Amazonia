                        <p>
                                There are over 40,000 plant species in the Amazon. Interesting enough, only a small percentage of these have been studied with room for a lot of research and discovery. Therefore, further research might find more plants and trees that have medicinal value which can be incorporated into the already available herbal medicines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The tropical climate of the Amazon is the biggest contributing factor for the vast types of plants. The varying climate ensures that all types of plants can grow during the different seasons and can be boosted by the presence of canopies. The canopy structure of the Rainforest offers sources of food, moisture and atmospheric regulation in the Rainforest, essential for the proper growth of plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Because the Amazon also has the largest number of indigenous forest people in the world, their knowledge of the medicinal plants yet to be discovered by modern researchers is potentially unrivalled. With the proper conservation of these plant species, a lot of good in terms of health and food can be uncovered.

                                    <p>The Giant Water Lily grows in the shallow waters of the Amazon River basin, as well as bayous and specific lakes in Brazil. This species is native to Brazil. The most interesting thing about this flower is the large leaves that it creates. The leaves can grow up to 46 centimeters in size and can hold up to 136 kilograms, the leaves are flat before growing rims at the edge of the leaf. The leaves are strong and stiff thanks to the strong bottom of the leaves.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> The Giant Water Lily adapts to the environment by growing thorns on the bottom of the leaves to protect itself from fishes and other predator that might want to eat it. Another adaptation is the rim around the edges of the leaves. These rims help protect the leaf from birds and insects that might want to eat the leaves (the rim is a barrier between the insects and the leaf).  The third adaptation of this Giant Water Lily is that the flower only lives for three days, it traps the beetles that come to pollinate the flower inside its core and then releases all its pollen on these beetles.

                                    <p>A favorite plant and flower to find in the Amazon Rainforest, the monkey brush (Combretum rotundifolium) has a unique appearance. The flowers resemble small bright red and yellow brushes due to their long stamens.</p>
                                    <p> The plant grows as a vine either on its own or as a parasite on other plants. It’s when they bloom that they takes on a fantastic appearance due to impressive flowers. Their bright colors attracts hummingbirds that pollinate the plants. They are found throughout the Amazon Rainforest and can often be seen near waterways.
                                    </p>

                                            The Monkey Brush is a striking vine native to South America. This exotic plant grows like a parasite on other plants and trees throughout the jungle. The flower acts as a natural feeding source for hummingbirds and a resting spot for green iguanas.

                                <p> Castor beans, known as Ricin, is one of the most poisonous naturally occuring substances known. The seeds from the castor bean plant, Ricinus communis, are poisonous to people, animals and insects.  An adult would have to eat about eight castor beans—after first removing the indigestible skin-to die. 
                                </p>
                                <p> In tropical regions, it grows as an evergreen shrub or tree that can reach 40 feet in height. In warm areas, this striking plant is grown as an annual. This plant can grow from seedling to a 10-foot tall plant by the end of the summer but will die back with the first frost.

                                        Lianas grow to around 200 meters (650 ft) with some growing much longer connecting many trees and plants. The vines start life on the forest floor like most of the Rainforest plants and then grow towards sunlight using trees as support. Rainforest communities use a few species for drinking water whereas others are a source of poisons, such as the famous curare.
                                </p>

                                        These woody vines are what hold up large trees in an expansive and complicated network. This is because tropical Rainforests have shallow soil and vines provide the support system. This also means that when large trees fall, the network of vines bring down surrounding trees opening up the canopy for seedlings and the next generation of growth.

                                        Pitcher plants can get pretty big. some get big enough to eat mice, rats, small animals, and yes, frogs. Most carnivorous plants are not dangerous to humans. It is located along the east coast of North America, in bogs and other wet locations with acidic soil.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        Pitcher plants resemble their name: they look like pitchers. Inside the elongated structure is a pool of water, a sweet and sugary liquid (similar to nectar) which smell attracts the potential victim. Once inside, the prey can no longer escape and will eventually be digested by the plant.  Decaying insects that have been trapped inside, along with nectar from the "lid," attract flies, beetles, butterflies and other insects to the plant. The plant's flowers are the color of raw meat, which further serves to attract flies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Some insects and animals live harmoniously with pitcher plants. Some predators, like spiders, use the lid to hide under, and some insect larvae, like mosquitoes, live inside the pitcher plant itself. Sometimes small frogs will hide in pitcher plants, eating flies that are attracted to the plant.

                                            This is another carnivorous plant, not just an insectivorous one. That means that, as well as insects, it also sometimes eats spiders. Plants can't eat anything much bigger than a housefly and mostly they eat mosquitoes and gnats. If you put the tip of your finger in the flytrap's bug eating mouth, it will quickly snap shut, but it won't hurt at all. In general, a trap will only close around and digest a meal three to five times before dying.
                                    </p>

                                            Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants native to a small region of wetlands in 
                                            the eastern United States. They have however been introduced to other areas of 
                                            the world and are popular as houseplants.
                                            It will reach a maximum size of about 13 cm and a single leaf trap may be a tad larger than 3cm in length.
                                            These plants have very short lives. Each individual 
                                            trap on the Venus flytrap can only operate three or four times, after which it 
                                            photosynthesizes like a normal leaf or dies back. The kapok tree is one of the largest trees in the Amazon Rainforest and is often referred to as the Giant of the Forest.

                                        This plant often produces egg-shaped orange fruits in warm British summers. They can be eaten when fully ripe, but please be aware that under-ripe fruits (yellow) can cause stomach upsets. Though the fruit is edible, it is rather insipid when eaten raw. A tea can be made of the flower which is said to alleviate stress and anxiety. 

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The passion flower is one of the most elaborate of all flowers found in the Rainforest. Passion-flower plants are vines. Many of the vines are found in the forest canopy and send their flowers down on long stems so that they can be in the understory where their pollinators live.
                                </p>

                                        They called it the passion flower because to them it symbolized the death of Christ. The five sepals and five petals of the flower, which are similar in appearance, represent the disciples without Peter and Judas.

                                        This sap of this tree, which can reach heights of up to 30 metres (100 feet), is still used in the industrial production of latex. When the tree’s bark is cut, the bright white sap oozes out; it’s then collected and processed into a number of products, including adhesives, solvents, and even chewing gum. Economically, the rubber tree is one of the most important trees in the Amazon Rainforest for indigenous peoples.

                                        Originally this plant was native to the Amazon Rainforest, however seeds were eventually illegally smuggled to Southeast Asia where the tree successfully propagated.    
                                        The plants live for hundreds of years, but take 7 years to be harvested for the first time. After those 7 years, it will produce sap for rubber for about 30 years

                                        They have adapted to life in the Rainforest by having their roots in the ground and climbing high into the tree canopy to reach available sunlight. Many lianas start life in the Rainforest canopy and send roots down to the ground. The leaves of forest trees have adapted to cope with exceptionally high rainfall.

                                A bromeliad is a tropical plant in the pineapple family (the family Bromeliaceae). Some bromeliads are brightly-colored epiphytes, which live on the branches and trunks of Rainforest trees. They have a remarkable way of getting water and food. The leaves act as gutters to collect rain, and the tank holds the water.

                            <p> 
                                    Bromeliads have a range of adaptations that have enabled them to survive. They have two main water collection adaptations. The leaves of Bromeliads have a covering of small wax crystals which makes the water run down the leaves where it forms a pool of water.

                                    As well as providing a home, the bromeliads are a source of water for many Rainforest animals. There are over 1,000 species of bromeliad and the entire family of Bromeliaceae are native to the Americas with only one species native to Africa.

                            <p> Palms are thought to be the most abundant plant in the Amazon Rainforest. The most abundant is the açai palm (Euterpe oleracea), which is a canopy species growing over 20 meters tall. Their berries feed a diversity of animals, including macaws, parrots, toucans, monkeys and more. The palms are often harvested for their inner core known as ‘heart of palm’, which is used in different dishes. Removing this kills the plant. If not well managed, this activity quickly becomes unsustainable and damages the forest.
