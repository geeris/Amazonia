                                The Amazon Rainforest is one of the main draws to the South American continent. With its lush vegetation, abundance of animals, and quality tours, many people visit the Amazon for a look back in time, a chance to see the world before human dominance, and as simply a break from normal life.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                                There are many attractions in the Amazon Rainforest. Amazon Rainforest Attractions include catching a glimpse of primal Earth as it was a few millions years ago and seeing the plethora of diverse and interesting wildlife.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Ecuador, part of Amazonia, is another fantastic place to explore for the Amazon Rainforest. The Rainforest in Ecuador accounts for one of the most wildlife-sections of Amazonia and there are some fantastic Rainforest lodges in Ecuador, such as the Sacha Lodge with its incredible canopy walkway that has to be experienced and seen to be believed.

                        <p>
                                You will most likely see Pink River Dolphins during your time in the Amazon. While on board the Desafio Amazon Cruise in Brazil, guests will visit a floating pier, where they can wade in the water while Pink River Dolphins are offered fish. It's very exciting to be up-close to these prehistoric looking creatures!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Because pink river dolphins are so friendly, swimming with them is possible on a guided boat excursion. They often swim right to the boat in order to get a closer look at their visitors. With the supervision of an experienced naturalist, don’t be afraid to grab a floatation device and jump in the water to get up close and personal with these gentle mammals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                If you are worried about potentially dangerous creatures lurking beneath the surface, there is really nothing to fear. Pink river dolphins have sophisticated sonar which allows them to send out electromagnetic pulses that bounce off of solid objects under water. If there are pink river dolphins around, then it is safe to say that there are not other predators posing immediate threat.

                                <p>
                                        Piranha fishing is a favorite activity among travelers to the Amazon River. These red-bellied fish are often portrayed as dangerous creatures, that can strip their prey down to the bones in seconds. Fortunately, for Amazon riverboat travellers, that is just a pop culture myth, and we can assure guests that they face no significant threat from these tiny fish. This excursion typically occurs in the afternoon, from a skiff. You’ll use a traditional wooden rode and your Amazon cruise guide will provide you with bait. Most guests return the piranhas back into the river.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Piranha can be found all throughout the Amazon River and its subsidiaries. In fact, piranhas are usually caught by accident while fishermen are targeting bigger catches. If you’ll be traveling the Amazon via river cruise, you’ll want to plan an excursion on a smaller canoe or boat to fish for piranha. The largest piranhas, 
                                        for more serious fishers, are said to be found in the Guyana Shield region.

                                <p> 
                                        Many Amazon river cruises will include excursions to fish for piranha, but if not you can always ask to add such a tour. For those who are passionate about fishing in the Amazon, you may be interested in a fishing-focused river cruise.

                                                Iguazu Falls is found just above the point where the Iguazu River joins with the Parana River to create a liquid boundary between Brazil and Argentina. The falls consist of roughly 275 individual waterfalls spread out over a 2-1/2-mile long curved cliff. Some of these waterfalls, separated from each other by small islands of greenery, plunge all the way to the bottom of the gorge, 269 feet below. Others are deflected by rocky outcrops that create large amounts of spray and mist, often colored with rainbows.

                                                The water flow is at its peak during the rainy season, typically November to March. During the dry season the falls have been known to slow to a trickle, even drying up completely as they did for 28 days during May and June of 1978. This is a rarity.
                                        </p>

                                                The Iguassu Parana rocks were originated from volcanic processes – called volcanism cracks that occurred in the region between approximately 165 120 million years.

                                                Together with the Iguazú National Park in Argentina, the park includes the most biological continuous important South-Central South America, with over 600 hectares of protected areas and other 400 000 in even primeval forests.

                                                    The Canopy Walkway is an experience unequaled in the Rainforest! At a height of over 35 meters (115 feet) and extending for 500 meters (one-third of a mile), the Canopy Walkway provides a view of the Rainforest from the treetops, the best vantage point for observing Amazon wildlife and vegetation. The Canopy Walkway is accessible to all and requires no special skills or equipment. The suspended walkway is spread between 14 of the area's largest Rainforest trees and is one of the longest canopy walkways in the world.

                                                        A jungle walk through the Amazon Rainforest is wonderful experience where you'll not only see the Amazon's unique wildlife, but also learn about the various medicinal plants that have been used for decades. On the ground look out for anaconda snakes, tarantulas, poison dart frogs, rubber trees and pineapple flowers. If you look up, you might be lucky enough to see a three-toed sloth hanging from a tree, or a group of squirrel monkeys jumping through the Rainforest canopy. 
                                                    
                                                <p> 
                                                        Even though the Amazon jungle has more than 1/3 of all animal species recorded in the world, including 1/5 of all birds on earth, it's still difficult to predict exactly what animals you'll see. Be sure to stay alert with your binoculars close-by!

                                                        <p>
                                                                Most Peruvian Amazon River cruises make a stop at the Manatee Rescue Centre just outside of Iquitos. Here, young manatees are rescued from the pet trade and are raised by staff. Orphaned and injured animals are cared for and rehabilitated, in order to be released back into the Rainforest. At the Manatee Rescue Centre, guests will be able to feed baby manatees, and spend time with sloths, anteaters, and monkeys. 
                                                        </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                            The center’s main focus is in caring for and releasing young manatees back into their natural habitat, often in Pacaya-Samiria, where they stand the best chance of survival, thanks to the park’s remoteness and protected status. 
                                                        
                                                    <p> 
                                                            Because Amazonian Manatees are very difficult to see in their natural habitat, this is often the only way to observe and interact with them, making this an important stop before boarding your Amazon cruise boat.
